# Individual Github Pages

## Navigating Notes and Plans for Each Tech Talk
In each Tech Talk, I will prepare questions and review the Tech Talk material beforehand. I will take notes on important key concepts for each TT. 

After completing the challenges associated with each TT, I will record my progress, struggles & key learnings in this Github Page (or on an alternative Jekyll site). TT challenge code will be executable through Repl.it.

## Test Prep Plans and Participation

I will follow what our Operational Officer has decided to do for our 10-person study team review. I will also be doing my additional own review, which is detailed below.

To prepare for the AP exam, by the AP Exam I will have done the full pracitce MC questions and FRQ questions from 2010 to most recently (or others, as I see fit). I will also be reviewing specific content that I find difficult by re-watching College Board videos or using other resources on the internet to practice more specific topics.

Topics I need to focus on:
* Writing and creating classes
* 2D Arrays (and nested for loops)
* ArrayLists and the special functions they have
* Recursive functions
* Inheritance: parent & child classes, super() keyword
* enhanced for loops
* When to use specific keywords for classes: private/public, static, void, when a return statement is necessary
* Different search algorithms
